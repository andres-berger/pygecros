# pygecros
  A pythonic version of GECROS
  
  This is a python interface for the model GECROS (Yin, 2005). Two flavors are in development. A f2py for the integration of all GECROS functions, and a pure python version. Both have been tested and validated against original model. New modules and modifications are under development for the pyhton flavor, among them: 1) An improved phenology model for soybean; 2) An improved soil model component includding a multilayered soil.
